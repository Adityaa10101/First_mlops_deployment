This repository demonstrates a foundational, end-to-end Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) pipeline for model serving and deployment using FastAPI and Docker.

The project simulates a real-world price prediction service for an e-commerce platform — built, packaged, and deployed in a production-ready containerized environment.

⚙️ Architecture & Tech Stack

This project emphasizes engineering rigor, reproducibility, and scalability.

Layer	Tool/Tech	Purpose
Framework	        🌀    FastAPI	High-performance, asynchronous REST API for model serving
Modeling	        📈    Scikit-learn	Simple regression model trained on simulated pricing data
Serialization	    💾    Joblib	Efficient saving/loading of model artifacts (model.pkl)
Validation	      🧩    Pydantic	Strict input schema enforcement for API requests
Containerization	🐳    Docker	Ensures reproducible, platform-independent deployment
🛠️ Deployment Instructions

The entire pipeline is containerized. Ensure Docker Desktop is running before proceeding.

1️⃣ Build the Docker Image
docker build -t price-predictor-api .

2️⃣ Run the Container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name predictor-service price-predictor-api

3️⃣ Test the API

Access the interactive documentation auto-generated by FastAPI:

🌐 Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Expand POST /predict

Click “Try it out” → Enter sample input → Test live predictions 🚀
